# CodeTest Pronounceable Passwords

**You objective** - Develop a well designed system in a language of your choice that can create an American English phonetically pronounceable password. Pronounceable should not be confused with dictionary words. While it is possible that you password generator could create dictionary words by accident they should be avoided.

**Constraints** - Limit yourself to 2 total days of work. I want the best solution not the fastest but the project must have lifecycle.

#### Example
- thriley
- castona

If I spoke these passwords outload to another person they would be able to use their native understanding of American English to spell them with great probability.

### Final Inteface
I will provide a length and will expect the pronounceable password of a reasonable length 8-12 characters to be pronouncable.

### Hints
1. Start with writing out an outline of project you will build (TDD might come in handy here).
2. I am the stakeholder and my contact is paul@savvysoftworks.com.
  - If you are unsure of your direction or my desires its important to formulate well thought-out communication with me to deliver the product.
  - Don't assume that I have given you all the details.
3. Research the problem so you can deliver a best practice solution. When this is delivered we will do a formal code review and I will expect that you understand why your code does what it does. You may be asked to revise your solution based upon feedback.

### Deliverable
- Source Code in a Git Repo
- Setup Readme (Assume I don't know anything about this project beforehand)
  - Dependencies
  - Explanation of how the project solves the problem stated
  - If any concrete examples from the greater internet were used please list those examples
  - If any Open Source Resources are included in your project list their source and license requirements.
